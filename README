CCD Training - Favor Composition over Inheritance - Event Sender

This project contains two interfaces used to send and receive events:
EventReceiver and EventSender

And three implementations of EventSender:
EventSenderBase, ReverseEventSenderBase, AsyncEventSenderBase

Adding an additional AsyncReverseEventSenderBase does not work out of the box
with clean code because the other event senders are created using an inheritance
hierarchy. Yes, I know that an asynchronous and reverse event sender does not
make much sense but it is good enough for this example ;)

Goal:
Refactor the event senders to use composition instead of inheritance so that an
AsyncReverseEventSender can be added.
